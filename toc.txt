How can we deliver content to users?
	Is data replication secure?

What Content Delivery Network (CDN) is?
	Single server / CDN scheme
	Cited CDNs properties
	Potential attacks

Secure Data Replication over Untrusted Hosts
	Dynamic queries on untrusted servers without state machine replication overhead?

Byzantine failures
	Byzantine-fault tolerant NFS

"Repeat and Compare"
	Components
	Requirements
	Main challenges
	Attestation records
		Overhead
	Verifiers
	Content Integrity
	Detection rather than prevention
	Completeness
	Accuracy
	Detection approaches
	Decentralized Trust
	Untrusted and Trusted Verifiers
	So with Untrusted and Trusted Verifiers we got
	Repeat
	Compare
	Detection
		Detection properties
		Pd misbehaving replica is detected
		T detect all misbeahving replicas
		Simulations
	Known issues
